     <p> Hunger is not merely a result of food scarcity; it is a reflection of deep-rooted injustice, inequality, and lack of compassion in our world. Every night, millions of people go to bed on empty stomachs, while perfectly good food is wasted elsewhere. This is not due to the planet’s inability to produce enough — it’s because of how resources are unfairly distributed. Hunger rarely makes headlines, yet it silently destroys lives every day, especially those of children. In a world capable of feeding billions, no one should suffer from hunger. Feeding the hungry is not just an act of charity — it is a basic expression of our shared humanity</p>

     <p> A good education system not only focuses on academic learning but also on character building, creativity, and practical skills. It helps students grow into responsible citizens and prepares them to face real-life challenges. However, many education systems still face issues like outdated methods, exam pressure, and lack of equal opportunities, which need improvement for a brighter future.</p>
       
     <img src ="https://left.eu/app/uploads/2024/03/NO-RACISM-scaled.jpg"alt="discrimination" width="30%" title="Discrimination">
     <p> Disability discrimination occurs when people with physical or mental disabilities are treated unfairly or excluded from opportunities that others enjoy. It can happen in schools, workplaces, or even in daily life, often due to lack of awareness or negative attitudes. Such discrimination limits the potential of disabled individuals and creates inequality in society. Promoting inclusion, accessibility, and respect can help break these barriers, ensuring that everyone gets equal rights and opportunities to live with dignity.</p>
